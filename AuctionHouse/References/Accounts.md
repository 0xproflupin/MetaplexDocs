# Accounts

## Auction House
Name: AuctionHouse

The `AuctionHouse` account is a Program Derived Address (PDA) which is derived from a given public key and, optionally, an SPL Token to use a currency. This PDA, also referenced as the Auction House `Instance`, is controlled by the `Authority`: the public key used to create the Auction House.

Auction House Instance PDA stores a variety of information, including important accounts that are needed to operate an Auction House like [FeeAccount](), [BuyerEscrowAccount](), [TreasueryAccount]() and many more.

This PDA is also the only point of configuration in the Auction House program and offers a variety of ways to custom tune your Auction House, like setting the currency of exchange for your marketplace, which can be an SPL token or SOL, marketplace royalties on every sale, etc.
